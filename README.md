# Reading Order Matters: Information Extraction from Visually-rich Documents by Token Path Prediction

This is the official repository of the EMNLP 2023 paper `Reading Order Matters: Information Extraction from Visually-rich Documents by Token Path Prediction`. 

* We have currently released the revised datasets FUNSD-r and CORD-r at [Token-Path-Prediction-Datasets](https://github.com/chongzhangFDU/Token-Path-Prediction-Datasets). 
* We apologize that due to the policies of Ant Group, the open-sourcing of the TPP project code continues to be postponed. It is recommended to refer to unofficial implementations of this work. 
If you find any trouble to re-implement the experiment results _after checking the issues of this repository_, please contact: chongzhang20@fudan.edu.cn.
