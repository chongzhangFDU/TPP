# Reading Order Matters: Information Extraction from Visually-rich Documents by Token Path Prediction

This is the official repository of the EMNLP 2023 paper `Reading Order Matters: Information Extraction from Visually-rich Documents by Token Path Prediction`. 

We have currently released the revised datasets FUNSD-r and CORD-r at [Token-Path-Prediction-Datasets](https://github.com/chongzhangFDU/Token-Path-Prediction-Datasets). 
The code implementation of this paper will be released soon.

Jan. 29 2024: Apologize for the delayed open-sourcing of the TPP project code. The open-sourcing process is subject to the policies of Ant Group, involving multiple procedural steps and is quite slow. If you find any trouble to re-implement the experiment results, please contact: chongzhang20@fudan.edu.cn.
